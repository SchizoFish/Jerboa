        Jerboas (from Arabic: جربوع‎ jarbūʻ ) form the bulk of the membership of the family Dipodidae. 
        Jerboas are hopping desert rodents found throughout Arabia, Northern Africa and Asia. They tend to live in hot deserts.
        When chased, jerboas can run at up to 24 kilometres per hour (about 15 mph). 
        Some species are preyed on by little owls (Athene noctua) in central Asia. 
        Most species of jerboa have excellent hearing that they use to avoid becoming the prey of nocturnal predators. 
        The typical lifespan of a jerboa is around six years.

    <h2>Diet</h2>
        Most jerboas rely on plant material as the main component of their diet, but they cannot eat hard seeds. 
        Some species opportunistically eat beetles and other insects they come across. 
        Unlike gerbils, jerboas are not known to store their food.

    <h2>Reproduction</h2>
        Mating systems of closely related species in the family Dipodidae suggest that they may be polygynous. 
        For some closely related jerboa species mating usually happens a short time after awaking from winter hibernation. 
        A female breeds twice in the summer, and raises from two to six young. Gestation time is between 25 and 35 days. 
        Little is known about parental investment in long-eared jerboas. 
        Like most mammals, females nurse and care for their young at least until they are weaned.
